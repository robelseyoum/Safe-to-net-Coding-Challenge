# Safe-to-net-Coding-Challenge
# Implement SpaceX rocket launches informative application
As a user, I want to see the list of rockets, when I open the application

●  For each rocket in the list the next attributes should be displayed: name, country and engines count <br />
●  When the application is opened for the first time it should display a welcome dialog <br />
●  As a user, I want to have possibility to filter the list and see only active rockets. <br />

(Parameter “active” should be used for filtering data)
The application should display a loading indicator if it is fetching data.
The application should allow a user to refresh the data.
